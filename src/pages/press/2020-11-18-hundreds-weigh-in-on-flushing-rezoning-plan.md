"Flushing residents and advocates showed up in virtual droves Nov. 9 to voice their opposition or support for the proposed Special Flushing Waterfront District, a controversial 29-acre rezoning plan.

The eight-hour City Council Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee public hearing included presentations by the developers and testimonies from over 100 public participants. Though not on the subcommittee, Councilmember Peter Koo (D-Flushing) hopped on the call to offer some positive perspective on the project, though he did not reveal how he will vote on the proposal when it moves to the full Council."
