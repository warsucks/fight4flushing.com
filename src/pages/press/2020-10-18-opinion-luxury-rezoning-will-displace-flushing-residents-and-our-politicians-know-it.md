In [March](https://ny.curbed.com/2020/3/16/21180842/coronavirus-new-york-state-eviction-moratorium), Gov. Andrew Cuomo closed housing courts throughout the state, concerned that rising unemployment would cause mass evictions during a global pandemic. But what was a legislative opportunity to secure housing for all has been effectively wasted, and as many as [50,000 New Yorkers are estimated to face eviction](https://ny.curbed.com/2020/3/26/21192343/coronavirus-new-york-eviction-moratorium-covid-19) when housing courts reopen. With the termination of added federal unemployment benefits, the situation will only worsen.
