  When the developers behind Industry City, a massive retail and manufacturing
  space, announced that they had pulled the plug on their plan to rezone a
  portion of their property on the Sunset Park waterfront in Brooklyn, community
  activists in Flushing, Queens celebrated.


  The proposed Special Flushing Waterfront District is a planned rezoning to usher in massive development along Flushing Creek, and is now being eyed by both proponents and critics as the next big New York City land use battle. The debate over the Flushing development hits on a number of persistent themes related to housing, development, gentrification, displacement, jobs, and more.
