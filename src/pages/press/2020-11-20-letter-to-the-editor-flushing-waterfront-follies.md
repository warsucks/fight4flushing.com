"In “[Separating Fact and Fiction About the Special Flushing Waterfront District](https://www.gothamgazette.com/opinion/130-opinion/9913-fact-vs-fiction-special-flushing-waterfront-district-development),” published earlier this week and in part an apparent response to [my criticism](https://www.gothamgazette.com/opinion/9896-flushing-tragedy-acute-affordable-housing-crisis-queens-development) of the Special Flushing Waterfront District (SFWD) in these pages, the property owners and applicants of the SFWD make one fact crystal clear, and that is that the developers do not represent community interests.

The developers continue to exaggerate the magnanimity of the proposed open space and waterfront access, which are the primary public benefits of the SFWD given the paltry number of proposed affordable housing units."
