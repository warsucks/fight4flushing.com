"City Councilmembers cross-questioned the Flushing Waterfront rezoning applicants Monday for details on affordable housing, open space, environmental impact and job opportunities related to the development project, which also faces a pending lawsuit in Queens Supreme Civil Court.

The entire City Council is due to vote on the private rezoning application for the Queens project, which would create a 29-acre waterfront special district with nine new buildings, including 1,725 apartments and other facilities. By tradition, the Council usually follows the vote of the councilmember in whose district a project falls, a practice known as member deference. The Flushing project is in the district represented by Councilmember Peter Koo, who is supportive of the rezoning plan despite opposition from local community groups."
