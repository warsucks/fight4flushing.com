"In 2016, local environmental organizations Guardians of Flushing Bay and the Riverkeeper released [a vision plan](https://www.riverkeeper.org/campaigns/restore-nyc-waterways/flushing-waterways-vision-plan/) for an integrated and ecologically healthy waterfront. Activists, community residents, and the Flushing Rezoning Community Alliance also published [a plan](http://minkwon.org/downloads/FRCA_Flushing_White_Paper_28apr16.pdf) that prioritized the needs of existing residents and discussed safeguards against displacement. Both of these plans were created after many representative community meetings and envisioned a neighborhood free from air and noise pollution, with a clean creek and community resources like senior centers and public parks.

What Flushing residents may receive instead is a massive luxury development proposal driven by the monetary interests of real estate developers F&T Group, United Construction and Development Group Inc, and Young Nian Group."
