Despite FRWA LLC’s efforts to characterize community opposition to the SFWD rezoning as “[misinformation](https://twitter.com/SFWDistrict/status/1304842279274905600?s=20)” by “[a small group of loud, misguided voices](https://twitter.com/SFWDistrict/status/1304842279274905600?s=20)”, presenting the massive waterfront market-rate residential, hotel, and retail development as a largely as-of-right project that will benefit Flushing’s immigrant community appears to me, as misinformation.
