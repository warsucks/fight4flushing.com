The City Planning Commission held a public hearing on Wednesday for the controversial Special Flushing Waterfront District project. Opponents held a rally in Flushing on \[September] 12th to protest against the development. Organizers, including local organizations MinKwon Center and the Chhaya CDC and state assemblyman Ron Kim, said Flushing needs more affordable housing, and the project would accelerate gentrification there.
