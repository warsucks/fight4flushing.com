"Dueling protests were held on Tuesday, Nov. 17, as groups of supporters and opponents of the Special Flushing Waterfront District (SFWD) voiced their concerns before the City Council Subcommittee vote on the rezoning application.

Tenants, workers, small business owners and elected officials were gathered outside by Starside Drugs, located at 136-36 39th Ave. in Flushing, to discuss the damages they believe will occur if the City Council votes in favor of the application.

Opponents of the SFWD include the MinKwon Center, Flushing Workers, Flushing Bay Alliance, Chhaya CDC, and the Greater Flushing Chamber of Commerce. They’re demanding that Councilman Peter Koo — who expressed strong support for the SFWD rezoning during the City Council Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee public hearing on Nov. 9 — oppose the plan."
