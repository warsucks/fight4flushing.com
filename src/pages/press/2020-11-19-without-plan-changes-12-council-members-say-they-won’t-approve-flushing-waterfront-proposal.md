"Opposition to a sprawling 13-tower, mixed-use development proposed for the Flushing waterfront is growing among city lawmakers tasked with approving the plans.

A dozen city council members said approving the project known as the “Special Flushing Waterfront District” in its current form would be “a grave mistake,” in a joint statement released Tuesday evening.

The members said the proposal — which calls for 1,725 apartments, multiple hotels, office and retail space as well as a brand new road network on 29-acres of private waterfront property — 'ignores the real, urgent needs of the Flushing community.'"
