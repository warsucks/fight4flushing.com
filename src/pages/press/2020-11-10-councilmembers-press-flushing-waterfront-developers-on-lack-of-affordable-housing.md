"They plan to create the bare minimum number of affordable units on the rezoned lot based on [the city’s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing land-use](https://council.nyc.gov/land-use/plans/mih-zqa/mih/) rules, spurring criticism from several councilmembers, including Antonio Reynoso. He challenged the contentious project during the Council hearing on FWRA’s land use application.

'Why should we not expect a level of affordable housing?' Reynoso said. 'Over 70,000 people are living in homeless shelters and you’re talking about nonsensical \[regulations] and saying you don’t need to do affordable housing.

'By law, you’re absolutely right, but I, as a councilmember, am supposed to look out for the best interests for the city of New York.' he added. 'This project doesn’t seem to have a purpose to get out of the hole that is affordable housing in New York.'”
