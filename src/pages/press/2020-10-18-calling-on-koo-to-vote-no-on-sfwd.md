Approximately 100 protesters gathered in front of the Flushing Library Sept. 12 and marched to City Councilmember Peter Kooâ€™s (D-Flushing) 38th Avenue office, calling on the representative to join them in rejecting the proposed redevelopment of a 29-acre stretch of waterfront industrial property and surrounding land in Downtown Flushing to construct a luxury condominium building, two hotels and retail establishments. The project would lie between 40th Road to the south, College Point Boulevard to the east, 36th Avenue to the north and Flushing Creek to the west.
