Community residents led by MinKwon Center for Community Action, Flushing Anti-Displacement Alliance (FADA), and Flushing for Equitable Development and Urban Planning (FED UP) organized a protest in Flushing, Queens, to urge New York City Council Member [Peter Koo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kxXvQfkSvmcYNkSYXtvzkOsB6aKXuu8L/view?usp=sharing) to oppose the redevelopment of the Special Flushing Waterfront District (SFWD). With more than 80 local Flushing residents and allies in attendance, the protest comes the weekend before the City Planning Commission's (CPC) public hearing on SFWD on Wednesday, September 16, 2020.
