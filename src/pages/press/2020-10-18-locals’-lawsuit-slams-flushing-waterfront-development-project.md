A trio of groups — Chhaya CDC, Minkwon Center for Community Action and the Greater Flushing Chamber of Commerce, along with a community member — have [filed suit](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=/rb4f8W63j_PLUS_1D9hiQ1XsrQ==) against the Department of City Planning and the City Planning Commission, arguing that an environmental review must be conducted for the 40-acre development proposal.

Since a three-developer consortium announced the Special Waterfront Flushing District project December 2019, sustained community opposition has centered around potential environmental, economic and social impacts the project could unleash on Flushing.
