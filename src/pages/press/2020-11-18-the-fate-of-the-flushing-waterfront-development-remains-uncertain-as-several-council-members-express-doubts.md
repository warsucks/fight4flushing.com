"The fate of the “Special Flushing Waterfront District” project lies in the hands of the City Council and many members have expressed misgivings about the plan over the past week.

Multiple council members have cast doubt as to whether they will support the project in its current form — arguing the project doesn’t include enough affordable housing units among their many concerns. One member has already announced that he will vote against it."
