"A dozen councilmembers have come out against a plan to rezone a piece of the Flushing Creek waterfront for residential use, delaying a crucial committeeâ€™s hearing on the land use measure before it heads for a full Council vote.

The rezoning would allow developers to create a 1,700-unit housing complex, alongside a hotel and retail space on the waterfront site and adjacent land they own and can build on as-of-right. The project is known as the Special Flushing Waterfront District, or SFWD.

Councilmember Francisco Moya drafted a [letter](https://twitter.com/FranciscoMoyaNY/status/1328837689513271298?s=20), signed by 11 other members Tuesday, opposing the SFWD rezoning, citing insufficient community benefits and minimal affordable housing. Moya chairs the subcommittee on zoning and franchises, which was scheduled to vote on the plan Wednesday. That vote has been postponed until Dec. 7."
