"A rally Tuesday calling on City Councilman Peter Koo to oppose rezoning an area along Flushing Creek to allow a controversial mega project met resistance.

Counter protestors support the zoning change, saying the development would bring needed jobs.

Opponents worry the project would further gentrify the area, pricing out longtime residents and businesses."
