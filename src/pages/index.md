  title: We Oppose the Special Flushing Waterfront District Project
  description: >+
    We are Flushing residents, workers, small business owners, and neighbors who
    oppose the “Special Flushing Waterfront District.” We demand that
    Councilmember Peter Koo vote No on the developers’ rezoning proposal that
    will only enrich them at the expense of our community.


    FWRA LLC--a partnership of three real estate development corporations, F&T Group, United Construction & Development Group, and Young Nian Group LLC--needs Councilmember Peter Koo to vote yes to the rezoning to move forward with their plan of building luxury condominiums, hotels, and office spaces. If Councilmember Koo votes yes, the developers will be able to build commercial properties and 1,725 luxury condominiums that current zoning does not permit them to build. We say NO to building any more luxury condos, which invite gentrification and will drive up our already unaffordable rents. We must stop the rezoning, stop the development, and stop the displacement of working class people from Flushing.


    The FWRA LLC developers and F&T’s construction company have donated a total of $20,625 to Councilmember Koo’s election campaigns. We demand that Councilmember Koo reject the rezoning, despite the developers’ campaign contributions. Our elected officials must stop serving the interests of real estate developers and speculators, while working people struggle to afford sky-rocketing rents. We need and deserve an economy that works for all of us, not just wealthy people, developers, and landlords.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
