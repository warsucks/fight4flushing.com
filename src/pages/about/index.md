### Mission Statement

In the last 20 years, Flushing has been transformed from the working-class, diverse community into one in which rich developers make huge profits by bringing mega luxury developments that no one can afford and destroy our community.

When Mayor de Blasio announced that he wants to rezone Flushing in 2015, a wave of predatory developers and landlords swooped into Flushing, buying up our buildings and land. They stopped doing repairs, kicked out many long term tenants and then hiked up the rents for new tenants. As a result, we lost so many actually affordable homes and we have been forced to pay much higher rents for less quality housing or double and triple up in homes to pay the high rents.

Flushing Commons, Tangrams, One Fulton Plaza, and many many more have displaced our small businesses and made rents for small businesses absurdly high in all of Flushing. Over the years, many businesses have been forced to relocate or simply close down, and as a result, we have lost jobs and businesses we need and love.

Our mission is to unite our diverse community to say enough is enough. We are sick and tired of being treated as second-class citizens. We want development, clean up of our creek, and to make Flushing more liveable but we want it for those of us who already live here, work here and do business here, not for the rich who will move in once we are displaced.



### **Our strategy**

Many of us are tired of our corrupt political system and our city’s government with Mayor de Blasio at the helm, that has sold off our communities to the highest bidder. However, just this month, the community in Sunset Park rallied together against a rezoning of Industry City in their neighborhood and won! The community organized and strongly demanded their councilmember FULLY reject the developers’ rezoning. This shows us we can win here too.

Here in Flushing, Councilmember Koo opposed this plan in 2016! He wrote a letter to the city saying that this development is like stuffing 10 pounds of potatoes into a 5 pound bag. He said that the project did not serve the interests of the community and so he could not support it. What changed since 2016? $20,000 that we know about in campaign contributions from the developers associated with the project. They have been working hard to buy him off since 2016.

Let’s not let this corruption continue. Let’s demand Council member Peter Koo come out against this developer rezoning and kill it in its tracks. Koo should instead support a rezoning from and for the community that will protect us from displacement.

Furthermore, displacement has been sped up by the coronavirus pandemic. Every day more businesses are closing and more jobs are being lost. Whether we are tenants or home owners, many of us are under more severe threat of losing our homes. We need rent relief and tax relief, not more luxury rezonings.

Join us to demand Councilmember Peter Koo stop the SFWD Rezoning and support an alternative plan that is to our benefit, not the developers.
